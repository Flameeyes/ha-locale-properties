# Home Assistant / Locale Properties Portal integration

This is a very rough web scraper for [Locale](https://locale.co.uk/) residential software solution.

I'm using this personally to be notified of new deliveries, and might extend to cover announcements
and a few other features, but don't expect proper support for this at this point.
